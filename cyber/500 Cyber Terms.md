    Chef
    Docker
    Containers
    Conjur : secrets management eg in Puppet
    Ansible = simpler version of Puppet : enforce server configuration
    Cloud foundry = containers. Installed over Docker. Use to build and deploy apps quickly. Pivotal cloud foundry also.
    Orchestration : manage containers
    Kubernetes : deploy, manage, group containers, allocate IP per group etc, roll out and roll back changes
    GKE Google Kubernetes Engine on Google Cloud : deploy containers
    Google Stackdriver : monitoring and logging with alerts, uptime etc

    Puppet : manages server configuration
    Puppet : server jobs and automation and config are inside code with VCS version control system controlling changes to the code
    Several big-name clients run their data centers using Puppet - Google, Reddit, Dell, PayPal, Oracle, Los Alamos Labs, and Stanford University; having such clients on board always lends a certain level of credibility to a product
    Puppet is free open source or enterprise $112 per year
    Conjur : manages secrets in Puppet
    Puppet : 30 minute heartbeat 'checkin'
    Puppet can continuously monitor and implement security and compliance policies
    Idempotency : don't change what does not need to be changed
    Desired state conflict detection
    Ongoing monitor and enforc config
    Remediate any drift
    Agentless
    Puppet 'bolt' is 'bolt' command on BASH shell
    So puppet is a prefix to commands run on a linux server, in order to monitor their execution
    Cisco equipment now has Puppet preloaded
    Works with orchestration eg Kubernetes
    
    Ansible : simpler version of Puppet
    Ansible : similar to Puppet ie server automation, scripting, configuration
    Ansible : centrally manages all scripting etc
    Ansible : define a job to run on nodes
    
    Cloud foundry backed by Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP
    Cloud foundtry - open source which makes it easier to build, test, deploy, scale applications
    Cloud foundry - container based architecture - deploy apps to this container. External 'Open Service API' permits exernal connections.
    Cloud foundry - is an install over Docker so Docker must be installed to use this
    Cloud foundry used by US GOV at [cloud.gov](http://cloud.gov/)
