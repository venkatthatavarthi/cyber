    SCAP Security Content Automation Protocol - does a system meet baseline security?
    CVE common vulernabilities and exposures
    Exploit Framework
    EMET Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit forces 3rd party apps to use NX and DEP for access ie No Execute and Data Execution Prevention - both prevent EXE from running
    Framework = Policy + Procedures + Guidelines
    Kill Chain is a sequence of steps taken by an attacker
    SIEM logs events - Security Info and Log Mgt
    Data Exfitration OUT
    Blackhole - Drop Packets
    Sinkhole - Redirect Packets
    Content based authentication eg date, time, location
    Exploit identity - gain access through identity of another
    Exploit browser - gain access through browser
    Exploit apps - gain access through apps
    Compensating Control - use when primary control fails.  EG encryption, separation of duties, user training

    NIST 800-53
    NIST control family - Access, Audit, Response, Risk
    NIST class - Technical (Firewall, AV, ACL, Audit), Operational, Management (Plan, Assess Risk, Authorise)
    NIST Operational - centred on people eg training, security guard, configuration, contingency plan, response plan, maintenance, media control, physical control
    CSA+ Controls - Physical (alarm, lock, fence,CCTV, mantrap, guard, badge), Logical, Admin 
    CSA+ Logical Control = software - OS, app, AV, ACL, IDS, password, biometric, smartcard, encryption, backup
    CSA+ Admin - Policy, Procedure
    Function : prevent, deter, detect, correct(during), compensate(after)
    CoA = Courses of Action = Matrix of Action
    FIPS 199 Impact Analysis = High/Med/Low
    Red attack
    Blue defend
    White rules, monitor
    No holds barred = any method
    Perimiter test
    Black box = blind
    White box = full disclosure
    Grey box = partial disclosure
    Single blind = only attacker blind
    Double blind = attacker and defenders are both blind
    NIST SP800-115 guide to testing
    PCI Payment Card Industry
    PCI DSS Data Security Standard
    Pre-engagement before test
    APT Advanced Persistent Threat 
    C2 command and control
    Kill Chain (Military) - Find, fix, track, target, engage, assess
    Kill Chain (Cyber) - Reconnaisance, Weaponise, Deliver, Exploit, Install, C2
    Pivot Point = weak point of entry for the attack
    Callback to rogue C2
    lateral = sideways
    action on objectives = goal
    OSINT
    Passive reconnaissance can use OSINT

    dork=fool 
    google dork = avoidable vulnerability found using google alone
    attack vector = path of attack
    dropped = malware placed on your system
    malvertising
    malspam
    Recovery: contain, eradicate, validate
    Containment: segment, remove, isolate, reverse engineer
    eradicate: sanitise,reconstruct,secure disposal
    Correction: Change control, lessons learned, update IRP
    Sheep dip = isolated computer and allow virus to try to attack while monitoring it
    Heuristic = real time
    Anomaly = pattern
    Behavioural = Beyond anomaly; uses models of known intrusions.  Uses TTP to infer when attack may be in progress
    TTP Tactics Techniques Procedures
    NAC access based on role, time, location
    RADIUS UDP
    TACACS+ TCP
    Air gap = isolation
    RBAC Role Based Access Control
    Sinkhole: detect flood and redirect
    TCP SYN attack can do service discovery
    nmap -o can detect operating system
    Syslog = logs only
    SIEM = logs + analysis
    nmap -sL = live hosts
    nmap -sn = ping scan (also -sP)
    nmap -Pn = port scan every IP on subnet
    nmap -PS 1.2.3.4-5.6.7.8 TCP SYN service discovery scan
    scope of scan = numbers of computers
